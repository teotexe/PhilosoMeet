# Philosomeet

**Philosomeet** is a web app designed for smartphones that guides users through a series of daily tasks inspired by the teachings of ancient Greek philosophers, adapted for modern life.

The app is part of a school project and draws inspiration from the book **_Lezioni di Felicit√†_** by writer and philosopher Ilaria Gaspari, who has supported and encouraged us throughout the entire development journey, which began in August 2023.

## How to Use the App

To use the app, simply click on this link from your smartphone: [Philosomeet Web App](https://www.liceovolterra.edu.it/wp-content/uploads/AppStudenti/index.html).

By swiping on the screen, you can navigate from one philosopher to another and discover daily advice for living the week ahead, inspired by the teachings of each philosopher.

## Features

- **Daily Tasks:** Receive simple tasks inspired by ancient Greek philosophy to help you lead a more meaningful and fulfilling life.
- **Philosopher Insights:** Explore timeless wisdom from philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, all adapted to suit the modern world.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Swipe between different philosophers to get fresh insights and ideas each day.

## Future development

We are willing to include an **"oracle"** using artificial intelligence through OpenAI or Gemini API.
