  _description: '

    Epicurus was an ancient Greek philosopher born on the island
    of Samos in 341 BC and died in 270 BC. He is the founder of the philosophical
    school of Epicureanism. Central to Epicurean philosophy is the "tetrapharmakos,"
    a four-part remedy leading to happiness by achieving ataraxia (serenity of the
    soul) and aponia (absence of physical pain). Epicurus taught that to attain these
    states, one must overcome the fear of gods, the fear of death, and the fear of
    physical pain, and should liberate oneself from unnecessary desires. Despite
    some of his ideas seeming outdated, like the fear of gods, the principle of a
    simple and sober life for happiness remains relevant. Therefore, we propose a
    journey inspired by the tetrapharmakos, emphasizing essential natural goods (food,
    water, air, clothes, shelter), necessary non-natural goods (houses, cooking tools,
    utensils), and avoiding unnecessary and non-natural goods (luxury items).



    The
    Epicureans were the followers of Epicurus and his teachings. The Epicurean school
    concentrated on ethics, maintaining that the ultimate goal of human life was
    happiness, which was to be achieved through the pursuit of reasonable pleasure
    and the minimization of pain. The Epicureans also believed in ataraxia, which
    means tranquility of the soul, and held that this could be achieved through the
    elimination of fears and excessive desires.'

        the object and ask yourself: Is it essential for my survival and well-being?
        For example, a pair of shoes is a necessary non-natural good, while a new
        fashionable pair falls into the category of unnecessary and non-natural goods.
        Remember to fulfill essential needs first and then non-essential ones. Reflect
        on your needs and desires. Is the object you desire truly necessary for your
        well-being, or is it just a momentary desire you can do without? '

        sure of yourself. You might post a photo of yourself on social media without
        overthinking or finding too many flaws in it. Remember that others' judgment
        is often temporary and influenced by their personal experiences. Don\u2019t
        let others' judgments define or influence your decisions. "

      _text: "Confront the fear of death. As Epicurus asserts, death cannot truly
        be encountered: if there is death, we are not; if we are, death is not. Additionally,
        it is impossible to know what comes after death, so we cannot define it as
        something to fear if we don\u2019t even know it. Therefore, we should try
        to accept our mortality and live life to the fullest."

      _text: 'Educate yourself about pain, understand its causes and treatments to
        demystify the experience and reduce the anxiety associated with it. Epicurus
        encouraged careful reflection on the sources of pain. Understanding that
        many fears stem from irrational anxieties or excessive worries can help reduce
        anxiety associated with pain. Remember that pain, sooner or later, is something
        temporary destined to pass: after overcoming pain, one feels significantly
        happier and relieved. If the pain leads to death, remember that after this,
        all suffering will have ended. '
