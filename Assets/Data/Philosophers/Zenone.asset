  _description: '

    Zenon of Citium was an ancient Greek philosopher, born in
    334 BC and died in 262 BC. He is primarily known as the founder of the philosophical
    school of Stoicism. Zenon taught in Athens, where he opened his school in the
    porch (Stoa in Greek, hence the name "Stoic"). The Stoics were followers of the
    philosophical school founded by Zenon. They believed in reason as the guiding
    force of the universe and the importance of living in accordance with nature.
    The Stoics promoted virtue as the highest good and upheld the distinction between
    what is under our control (our actions, attitudes, and opinions) and what is
    not (external events and circumstances). The Stoics believed that achieving apathy,
    or an undisturbed emotional equilibrium, was a desirable goal. Among the most
    famous Stoics are Zenon himself, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius.'
