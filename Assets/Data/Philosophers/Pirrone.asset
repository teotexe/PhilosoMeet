  _description: '

    Pyrrho, also known as Pyrrho of Elis, was an ancient Greek
    philosopher born around 360 BCE and is considered the founder of the skeptical
    movement, known as Pyrrhonian skepticism. Pyrrho was a student of Anaxarchus
    and traveled with Alexander the Great during his conquests.



    The skeptics,
    followers of skeptical doctrines, were a group of philosophers who developed
    a philosophical perspective that questioned the possibility of attaining certain
    knowledge on any subject. They emphasized the importance of suspending judgment
    and seeking inner tranquility by abstaining from making judgments on controversial
    matters. The skeptics did not believe in the possibility of arriving at an absolute
    truth and argued that every argument had equally valid pros and cons.'
