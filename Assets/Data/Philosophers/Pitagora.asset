  _description: '

    Pythagoras was a philosopher, mathematician, and mystic of
    ancient Greece, born around 570 B.C. in the Greek colony of Samos, in present-day
    Turkey, and died around 495 B.C. in Metapontum, Italy. He is famous for his significant
    contributions to mathematics, philosophy, and religion.



    The Pythagoreans
    were the followers and students of Pythagoras. They formed a philosophical school
    dedicated to the study of natural sciences, mathematics, music, and moral philosophy.
    The Pythagoreans placed great importance on mathematics and believed that mathematical
    principles were the key to understanding the universe. Their school was based
    on principles of community, sharing ideas and resources among the members of
    the sect. Some of the main contributions of the Pythagoreans include the Pythagorean
    theorem in geometry, the discovery of musical proportions, and the theory of
    immortal souls.'
